# Download music youtube

This app downloads all the songs from a certain playlist or a specific song you want directly from youtube and converts them to mp3 automatically.

We recommend using python 3.8.10 to run the application.

As soon as you start the application a graphical interface will open, in this interface you have the link field where the url of the playlist or video that will be downloaded must be inserted.

By clicking on the button that says "Baixar Música" the song will be downloaded, in the case of a playlist it will download each song individually.

The area below the "Baixar Música" button is an area where you can keep track of the status of your music.
